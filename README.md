# Password Generator

This application displays an interface that allows users to generate a password. When the "Make My Password" button is clicked, the user will be presented with prompts asking what kind of password they would like generated. These prompts ask how long the password should be and what kind of characters should be included. The available characters the user has to choose from are lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and special characters. 

Once all prompts have been answered validly, the application will create a password that is the specified length and contains the desired character types. The placement of the characters in the final password are decided randomly. The user can create another password by clicking the button again.
